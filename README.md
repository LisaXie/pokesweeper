# Pokesweeper
Minesweeper with Pokemon sprites. You can play it [here](http://pokesweeper.takumifujimoto.com).

## Requirements
Pokesweeper requires Node.js and TypeScript. Clone the repository, run `npm install` and `tsc` in the root directory, then `node app` to start.

This repository doesn't include the sprites, so you'll have to put your own sprites named `000.png` through `721.png` in the `sprites/` directory.
